# Credit Risk PD Modeling & Credit Scorecard (End-to-End)

## 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates an **end-to-end credit risk modeling pipeline**, starting from **Probability of Default (PD) estimation** and extending to **credit scorecard development**. The workflow is designed to closely mirror **industry and regulatory practices used in banks**, with a strong focus on **interpretability, validation, and governance**.

The project is intentionally built using **logistic regression**, reflecting its widespread acceptance in **credit risk modeling and model validation environments**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

* Build an interpretable **PD model** for retail credit risk using logistic regression
* Evaluate model performance using **bank-standard metrics** (AUC, Gini, KS)
* Improve probability accuracy through **calibration techniques**
* Convert calibrated PDs into a **production-style credit scorecard** using log-odds and PDO scaling
* Demonstrate a **clear linkage** between statistical modeling outputs and business decisioning

---

## 📂 Dataset

* **Home Credit Default Risk Dataset** (Kaggle)
* Target variable: `TARGET` (1 = Default, 0 = Non-default)
* Features include demographic, financial, and behavioral variables

> ⚠️ Note: This project uses publicly available data. No proprietary or bank data is included.

---

## 🧠 Methodology

### 1️⃣ Data Preparation & Exploration

* Missing value treatment (median / mode imputation)
* Categorical variable encoding
* Feature scaling for numerical stability
* Train / validation data split

### 2️⃣ PD Model Development

* **Logistic Regression** with L1/L2 regularization
* Regularization used to control overfitting and improve stability
* Model trained to estimate borrower-level **Probability of Default (PD)**

### 3️⃣ Model Evaluation (Discrimination)

* **ROC-AUC** – ranking power
* **Gini Coefficient** – normalized discriminatory strength
* **KS Statistic** – separation between default and non-default populations

### 4️⃣ Probability Calibration

* Calibration curves to assess probability accuracy
* **Platt Scaling (Sigmoid calibration)** applied
* Brier Score used to compare calibrated vs uncalibrated outputs

> Distinction maintained between **discrimination** and **calibration**, as expected in banking model validation.

## 🔁 PD → Credit Scorecard Conversion

### Why a Scorecard?

* PDs are statistically accurate but difficult for business use
* Credit scores are **stable, monotonic, and interpretable**

### Steps:

* Convert PD to **log-odds**
* Apply **Points-to-Double-Odds (PDO)** scaling
* Anchor scores using base score and base odds
* Create score bands for risk segmentation

> Higher score = lower default risk

---

## 📊 Validation of Scorecard

* Default rate monotonicity across score bands
* KS statistic using score
* AUC invariance check (score is a transformation of PD)

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

* **Python**: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn
* **Modeling**: Logistic Regression (Regularized)
* **Validation Metrics**: AUC, Gini, KS, Brier Score
* **Visualization**: matplotlib
